 <h2>Usability Study of QQ Browser (based on Android)</h2>
 <p><em>Note: Teamwork</em></p>

<h3>Team Role:</h3><p>organizer, reporter</p>
<h3>Duration:</h3><p>March 2013 - June 2013</p>
<h3>Main Functions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To learn how students use their cellphones and apps.</li>
    <li>To do usability study on some functions of QQ Browser.</li>
    <li>To talk with students about their opinions and needs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Contributions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Offered questionnaire and task script.</li>
<li>Organized the usability study.</li>
<li>Wrote the final report.</li>
<li>Optimized several functions according to the results of the two usability studies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>We went to Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) and Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CUPT) respectively to investigate two different groups of college students. Students from SUFE mainly major in finance and economics, while students from CUPT mainly major in engineering. The results of usability test showed that education background could largely affect how students use browser. Specifically speaking, students from SUFE used more advanced features of browser, such as saving webpage for offline use, synchronizing bookmarks, and downloading software form browser’s software market. In contrast, students from SUFE basically just used browser for searching information, watching news and browsing social networking sites.</p>

<p>Another general phenomenon was the limit of monthly data allowance, internet speed, and accessing to WiFi. In China, monthly data allowance for cellphone is mainly from 30M-100M, only 30% of the people who use cellphone to access to network use 3G network, and less than 30% of these people use WiFi. Based on these facts, people, including students of course, prefer simple and small webpages when they are using cellphone browser because these websites require only little data usage.</p>
<p>We also conducted usability test on some central functions of QQ Brower, such as bookmark, share and news. During the usability test, sers did some required tasks according to a script while we learned and watched alongside. Besides, by face-to-face interview we discussed with students about the possible revisions of QQ Browser they liked and what function they thought they needed the most. They also showed us their classroom, cafeteria, and dormitory where they usually used QQ Browser.</p>
<p>Optimization based on these two usability test were made. For instance, QQ Browser now can convert a large webpage into a relatively small one. This feature is among users’ favorites and leads to the increase of PV.</p>
