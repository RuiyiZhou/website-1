User research at stage 1 was twofold: we used a survey to investigate which indicators describing destination countries were more important to users, and we used an HTML prototype created in Axure to gauge user reaction to the overall design goals of country comparison across aggregate rankings as well as the interaction design.</p>

<h3>Content Title 3</h3>
Users indicated that they were less influenced than we had expected by concerns about cultural differences in choosing a destination country. They indicated that climate and weather information, concerns about crime and physical safety, health problems/disease, and the perceived political stability of their travel destinations were stronger influences in their travel planning. More significantly, users had difficulty comparing different dimensions in the circular bar chart. They were confused by the visual proximity of aggregate dimensions that had no statistical relationship, and they (understandably) wanted to see what measures underlay the aggregates. Some users pointed out that the key indicators (for them) were missing, and wanted others. One reviewer also recommended a simpler design goal: create a visualization that simply helped users discover travel information and make travel decisions quickly, rather than investigate their decision-making.

<p>TraveLENS is an interactive visualization tool that equips potential travellers with data and information across a wide range of risk factors that could influence in their decision-making process. The word ‘lens’ in the name is a metaphor for the main concept behind the tool. It is designed to let the users see and explore the world through different categories of lenses depending on their tasks and goals, and the visualization is designed to adapt and morph to fit the requirements of each category and to present that category’s information in the most effective and expressive way. For example, the Health lens visualizes vaccination requirements or food safety recommendations for travellers. Because the data is mostly relational in nature and less quantitative, we visualize the correlation with lines and arcs between entities. Another example would be the Safety lens where we visualize crime rates using choropleth, trend lines, or histograms. Similar to how you can combine multiple lenses and filters to create different views, the users of TraveLENS might combine multiple lenses to see correlations between various data sets. This concept of ‘lens’ is also a powerful reminder for us to focus on the visuals--the presentation and the perception of data--rather than the raw data itself.</p>
