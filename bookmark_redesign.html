<h3 class="sectiontitle">Project Description</h3>
<p>QQ Browser once had two separate bookmark systems. One bookmark system was shown on the homepage of browser, which we called the homepage bookmark. Homepage bookmark was designed to mark the frequently-used websites. Users were able to send some of these homepage bookmarks to desktop of their mobile phones. Another bookmark system was shown on the bookmark page, which could be accessed through main menu of the browser. We called this bookmark system the common bookmark. Common bookmark was designed before the homepage bookmark to offer the basic capability of saving bookmarks and it was not that different from the homepage bookmark except it was not shown on the browser's homepage. There was a kind of redundancy here. Besides, most users were sticking to a particular kind of bookmark system they were familiar with, and were not willing to change their habits. Thus we separated the users of bookmark into two groups because of the bad design.</p>
<p>To solve this program, we redesigned to bind in these two bookmark systems into one. The key design concept was that all bookmarks were stored on the bookmark page, while users could send some frequently-used bookmarks to the browser's homepage for convenient use, just like users could send some bookmarks to the desktop of mobile phone.</p>
