 <h2>Bookmark Redesign for QQ Browser (based on Android)</h2>
 <p><em>Note: Teamwork</em></p>

<h3>Team Role:</h3><p>UI designer, product manager</p>
<h3>Duration:</h3><p>January 2013 - June 2013</p>
<h3>Website:</h3><p><a href="http://mb.qq.com">mb.qq.com</a></p>
<h3>Main Functions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Users now do not need to choose from one of the two bookmark systems every time they are adding a bookmark. Instead, they only need to choose where they need the bookmark to be showed, the homepage of QQ Browser or the bookmark page.</li>
    <li>All bookmarks users added will be automatically synchronized to other platforms. Users using different devices such as personal computer, smartphone, and iPad, can now find their bookmarks on all the devices.</li>
</ul>

<li>Offered three different design plans for choice and discussion.</li>
<li>Prototyped.</li>
<li>Conducted usability study during the design process.</li>
<li>After release, supervised user feedback and offered optimization plan.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>QQ Browser once had two separate bookmark systems. One bookmark system was shown on the homepage of browser, which we called the homepage bookmark. Homepage bookmark was designed to mark the frequently-used websites. Users were able to send some of these homepage bookmarks to desktop of their mobile phones. Another bookmark system was shown on the bookmark page, which could be accessed through main menu of the browser. We called this bookmark system the common bookmark. Common bookmark was designed before the homepage bookmark to offer the basic capability of saving bookmarks and it was not that different from the homepage bookmark except it was not shown on the browser's homepage. There was a kind of redundancy here. Besides, most users were sticking to a particular kind of bookmark system they were familiar with, and were not willing to change their habits. Thus we separated the users of bookmark into two groups because of the bad design.</p>
<p>To solve this program, we redesigned to bind in these two bookmark systems into one. The key design concept was that all bookmarks were stored on the bookmark page, while users could send some frequently-used bookmarks to the browser's homepage for convenient use, just like users could send some bookmarks to the desktop of mobile phone.</p>
