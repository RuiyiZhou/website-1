<h3 class="sectiontitle">Project Description</h3>
<p>I communicated with users from all over China via online IM, phone calls, emails, face-to-face interview, etc. I dealt with more than 500 feedbacks a day. I sorted these feedbacks into different categories according to their worth. About 5% of the feedbacks were very valuable, these feedbacks either reflected severe bugs or hard-to-accept designs. Once getting these feedbacks, I would immediately build up a team to revise our designs and codes. If necessary, an updated version would be released within 3 days since the feedback.</p>
<p>Besides, I cultivated users' passion and loyalty by running various activities both online and offline. Recently, at the end of year 2012, I sent letters of thanks and gifts to some valuable users who had been supportive during the whole year. Their happiness of getting these letters and gifts were spread out through online social networking such as Weibo and attracted many new users of QQ Browsers. Each month, a name list of valuable users would be updated and the users on the list would get a gift, and their name would appear on the thanks page of each released version of QQ Browser. Now, thanks to the loyalty cultivation plan, we have more than 500 valuable users who actively offered their help to us, such as being the admin of online forum, answering other users' questions about the product, and pointing out the bugs and bad designs we left out.</p>
