<h3 class="sectiontitle">Project Description</h3>
<p>QR Code could store the information of a paragraph of words, a HTML link, a name card, etc. The principle of QR Code Scanning was that if we use the camera to shoot a QR Code, QQ Browser could decode the QR Code and get the information stored in it. We reinforced the QR Code Scanning to make it much stronger. First of all, QQ Browser could recognize a paragraph of words, and a HTML link, which could be either stored as a bookmark or open in a new window. Secondly, QQ Browser could recognize the information of a name card, and users could save the information directly as a name card in contacts, or dial the phone number offered, or send an email to the email address offered.</p>

<p>What was more, not only the QR Code shot by the camera could be recognized, the QR Code stored locally on the phone and the QR Code showed on a webpage could also be recognized, which was quiet original because other apps or software could only recognize the QR Code shot by the camera.</p>

<p>In addition, we also supported the recognition of barcode, which was widely used on almost every product. Users could use QQ Browser to recognize the barcode and search for more information on the Internet. In the future, users might be able to buy the product they wanted by using QQ Browser to scan the barcode.</p>
